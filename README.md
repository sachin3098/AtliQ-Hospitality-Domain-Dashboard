<p>AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. </p>
<p>Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands is losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category.</p>
 <p>As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.</p>
<p>Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.</p>

<p><b>Task</b></p>
<p>1.Create the metrics according to the metric list.</p>
<p>2.Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.</p>
<p>3.Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.</p>

<p><b>Action:</b></p>
<p>1. Load the data in Power-BI & conduct the data exploration, and cleaning.</p>
<p>2. As per the stack holder request created the KPI needs to be tracked.</p>
<p>3. Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI to create calculated measures for the defined metrics.EX calculate occupancy rate % and ADR.</p>
<p>4. Referencing the mock-up dashboard provided by the stakeholders, design the layout of the dashboard in Power BI.</p>
<p>5. Implement interactive features in the dashboard, such as slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities, to allow users to explore the data based on their specific interests and requirements.</p>

<p><b>Result</b></p>
